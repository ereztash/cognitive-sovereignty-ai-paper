# From Cognitive Offloading to Cognitive Sovereignty

## A Computational-Metacognitive Model of Human-AI Thinking

Erez Tal-Shir

## Abstract

Generative AI systems increasingly perform cognitive operations that were previously carried out by human users, including summarization, writing, reasoning support, planning, and decision framing. This paper argues that the cognitive effect of AI use is not determined by whether a task is offloaded, but by whether offloading is governed by metacognitive calibration. I propose a computational-metacognitive model in which AI-mediated cognitive offloading produces two divergent trajectories. Uncalibrated offloading may increase short-term task performance while reducing critical thinking retention and cognitive sovereignty. Calibrated or fortified AI use may improve performance while preserving or increasing the user's ability to evaluate, override, explain, and internalize outputs.

The paper combines theoretical synthesis with reproducible Python analyses. First, a structural text-coding analysis evaluates whether the source thesis coherently connects metacognition, algorithmization, cognitive offloading, tacit knowledge, cognitive risk, and fortified cognition. Second, an agent-based simulation formalizes model predictions across four conditions: no AI, uncalibrated AI, calibrated AI, and fortified AI. The model predicts that uncalibrated AI produces a performance-sovereignty gap, whereas fortified AI yields the strongest joint outcome across performance, critical thinking, and cognitive sovereignty. The contribution is a falsifiable framework for designing human-AI systems that preserve agency rather than merely maximize output fluency.

## 1. Introduction

AI systems are commonly evaluated through productivity, accuracy, speed, or user satisfaction. These metrics are necessary but insufficient. They do not directly measure whether the user remains capable of understanding, evaluating, and independently reconstructing the cognitive work that the system performs.

This paper introduces cognitive sovereignty as a central design and research construct. Cognitive sovereignty refers to a user's retained capacity to inspect, challenge, revise, and internalize AI-mediated reasoning. It is not the rejection of AI assistance. It is the ability to use external cognition without becoming epistemically dependent on it.

The central claim is simple: AI is not cognitively harmful or beneficial by default. Its effect depends on the architecture of offloading. When users delegate effort without calibration, AI can become a cognitive bypass. When users delegate under metacognitive gates, AI can become a cognitive amplifier.

## 2. Theoretical background

### 2.1 Metacognition and task decomposition

Metacognition is the capacity to monitor and regulate one's own cognitive processes. It enables a person to step back from an ongoing action and represent it as a sequence of decisions, checks, and subgoals. This ability is a precondition for algorithmization. A task that cannot be decomposed cannot be reliably delegated to a formal or computational system.

### 2.2 Computational theory of mind

The computational theory of mind provides one theoretical basis for translating thought into executable procedure. If some forms of cognition can be described as information processing over structured representations, then at least some cognitive operations can be formalized, externalized, and executed by non-biological systems.

This paper does not claim that all human thinking is computational in the classical symbolic sense. It uses computationalism as a partial bridge: some cognitive procedures are formalizable, but the boundary of formalization remains theoretically and practically important.

### 2.3 Tacit knowledge and the limit of explicit coding

Polanyi's paradox states that people can know more than they can tell. Skilled judgment often depends on embodied, contextual, and tacit knowledge. Dreyfus's critique of classical AI reinforces this limit by arguing that human intelligence is situated, practical, and socially embedded.

These critiques prevent an overextended claim. The model proposed here does not assume that AI can fully replace human cognition. It assumes that AI can execute formalized parts of cognition, while the user must retain sovereignty over interpretation, validation, and contextual judgment.

### 2.4 Cognitive offloading and extended mind

Cognitive offloading occurs when a person uses external tools to reduce internal cognitive demand. Notebooks, calendars, calculators, search engines, and AI systems can all serve this function. The extended mind thesis provides a philosophical frame: tools may become functionally integrated into cognitive systems when they are reliably available and actively used.

The problem begins when offloading becomes frictionless and unexamined. A tool that expands cognition can also displace the activity required to maintain cognitive competence.

## 3. Model

The proposed model contains six constructs:

- Offloading intensity
- Metacognitive calibration
- Foundational knowledge
- Reflection demand
- Critical thinking retention
- Cognitive sovereignty

The model predicts a nonlinear relationship. Offloading can increase performance. But without calibration, offloading can reduce sovereignty. With calibration, offloading can increase performance without suppressing critical thinking.

## 4. Hypotheses

H1: High AI offloading without metacognitive calibration will improve short-term task performance while reducing cognitive sovereignty.

H2: Metacognitive calibration will moderate the relationship between AI offloading and critical thinking retention.

H3: Fortified AI interfaces will outperform uncalibrated AI interfaces on the joint outcome of performance, critical thinking, and cognitive sovereignty.

H4: Foundational knowledge will protect users from over-dependence by improving error detection and output evaluation.

## 5. Computational method

The repository includes two reproducible analyses.

### 5.1 Structural text-coding analysis

The first script segments the source thesis into fixed-length analytic chunks. It then codes each chunk using lexicons associated with the paper's theoretical constructs.

The analysis estimates total mentions, chunk coverage, pairwise co-occurrence, and smoothed pairwise association.

This is not a validation of truth. It is an internal-structure diagnostic. It evaluates whether the theoretical document already contains a coherent chain linking metacognition, algorithmization, offloading, risk, and remedy.

### 5.2 Agent-based simulation

The second script simulates repeated learning or usage sessions across four conditions:

1. No AI
2. Uncalibrated AI
3. Calibrated AI
4. Fortified AI

Each condition is parameterized by offloading intensity, calibration, foundational knowledge, and reflection demand. The simulation then estimates trajectories for performance, critical thinking, and cognitive sovereignty.

The simulation is not empirical evidence. It is a formalized prediction engine. Its value lies in making the theory falsifiable.

## 6. Preliminary results

The structural analysis found that the source document strongly covers algorithmization, metacognition, cognitive offloading, tacit knowledge, risk, and fortified cognition. The strongest co-occurrence paths connect metacognition with algorithmization, algorithmization with offloading, and offloading with cognitive risk.

The simulation predicts a performance-sovereignty divergence under uncalibrated AI. This condition improves task performance relative to no AI but sharply reduces cognitive sovereignty. Fortified AI produces the strongest combined outcome, preserving sovereignty while improving performance.

## 7. Discussion

The model reframes the debate about AI and cognition. The central question is not whether humans should use AI. The central question is what kind of cognitive contract the interface enforces.

A frictionless answer engine optimizes immediate output. A fortified cognitive interface optimizes retained capacity. The former may create dependence. The latter may create transfer.

The practical implication is that AI systems should include metacognitive gates. These may include confidence prediction, error detection prompts, source comparison, user-generated explanation, delayed reveal, and post-output reconstruction.

## 8. Limitations

The present work is theoretical and computational. The text analysis evaluates internal coherence, not external validity. The simulation expresses model assumptions, not real human behavior.

The next stage requires an empirical study with human participants. Such a study should compare unassisted work, unconstrained AI use, and fortified AI use. Outcomes should include immediate performance, delayed retention, calibration accuracy, error detection, and independent reconstruction.

## 9. Conclusion

AI-mediated offloading is not merely a productivity issue. It is a cognitive architecture issue. The same tool can either bypass thought or strengthen it, depending on whether it preserves metacognitive effort.

The proposed model suggests that the future of beneficial AI is not less thinking. It is better-distributed thinking under human sovereignty.
